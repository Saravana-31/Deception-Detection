# 🧠 Deception Detection Using Facial Images

A deep learning project that detects deceptive behavior from facial images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## 📌 Overview

This project uses image processing and CNN models to classify facial expressions as **deceptive** or **truthful**. It is built and tested using Python, TensorFlow/Keras, and executed on Google Colab.

## 🖼️ What Makes It Different?

Unlike traditional NLP deception models, this project leverages visual facial cues — microexpressions and patterns — to detect lying behavior using image data.

## 🔧 Techniques & Tools Used

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Image preprocessing (resizing, normalization)
- Augmentation with `ImageDataGenerator`
- Model evaluation: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix
- Google Colab

## 📂 Dataset

- The dataset contains labeled facial images (truthful/deceptive)
- Images are preprocessed to standard dimensions (e.g., 224x224)
- If dataset is not public, placeholder/sample images are provided

> Note: For larger datasets, use Google Drive integration in Colab.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Upload your dataset or connect to Google Drive
3. Run all cells to:
   - Load data
   - Train CNN model
   - Evaluate accuracy and visualize performance
